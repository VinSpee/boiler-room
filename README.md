# BOILER ROOM

I have a strong set of opinions. I like:
- [PostCSS](http://github.com/postcss)
- [SUITCSS](http://suitcss.github.io)
- [ES6](http://exploringjs.com)
- [SVG Icons](https://css-tricks.com/svg-use-external-source/)
- Injecting CSS upon change
- Instant reloading of JS

I want to be able to start a project quickly. If you're with me on these
things, you've found what you're looking for.
